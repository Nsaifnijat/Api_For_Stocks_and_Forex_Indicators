#in the Indicator_Api file we calculate the values of the bollinger bands indicator once the correct parameters is passed to the right function through our request.
#in the SampleRequest file we try to return our calcualted bollinger bands values.
#the usecase of this repo is mainly for microservices, where you need to calculate the values of bollinger bands using python and get the values in your program of choice. 
Note: the sample request can be written in any language and if you have the indicator api file running, then you will receive the values of bollinger bands.
here bollinger bands is an example you can change it to any indicator, also you will need to bring some changes accordingly in production.
